# Project Info â€“ Private Code Repository ðŸŒŸ

This repository serves as a **placeholder** for projects I've created/worked on where the **source code is private** and cannot be publicly shared due to company policies, NDAs, or other confidentiality reasons.

## About These Projects ðŸš€

Each linked project was fully or partially developed by me and may include:
- Web Design,
- Frontend development (React, Vue, TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, etc.)
- Responsive design and UI/UX implementation,
- Routing, i18n, theming, animations, SEO setup,
- API integrations and reusable component architecture.

## Why This Repo Exists ðŸ“Œ
GitHub is often used to showcase code-based contributions. Since I'm unable to share certain repositories, this placeholder acts as a reference for such projects.
